sorting.c is a program which uses C and H files for minsort, bubblesort,
insertionsort, quicksort, and mergesort, as well as bv.c anc bv.h to take 
in command line arguments and perform certain functions based on what is 
entered in throught the command line. You can run certain sorts, change the
seed used to generate the random numbers, change the size of the array and 
the number of elements printed. Most code was provided by DDEL.
