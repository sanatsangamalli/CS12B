banhammer.c is a program which uses C and H files to map bad words. I
use 2 bloom filters per instructions to map a word to see if it's a bad
word, and then map it to a hash table to see if there is a translation 
for the word that is more politically correct. Depending on the case,
you list the errors and the new words. This is the case whether you read
in user input or a file. It will also handle the cases where the words entered
are in both the badspeak and the newspeak files. Most code was provided by DDEL.
