increment.c is a program that takes in a command line argument to spawn
a number of threads specified by the user. Using a thread safe function
to prevent a race condition, it increments a global variable each time it 
calls that function(1000 times total, specified in the instructions). So
each thread will call this function 1000 times total, and if coded correctly
will produce the same result each time it is run(number of threads * 1000).
If not executed correctly, it will produce a race condition.
mutex: A mutex is something that, when acquired by a certain thread, will
allow that specific thread to run its specific instructions while at the 
same time halting other threads' instructions from executing until they 
acquire the mutex. Only one thread at a time can acquire the mutex.
race condition: A bug where the operating system will try to execute
multiple instructions at the same time and produce a result that is wrong. Since 
the conditions to enter a race condition are very hard to fulfill, this
only happens a small percentage of the time.
