/*
 * This file is meant to be used with lab3. There is an error in this file which
 * results in a segmentation fault.
 *
 * Your job is to figure out which line of code causes this segmentation fault
 * and you also need to figure out why the segmentation fault occurs.
 *
 * TODO: 1. Compile Using
 *  gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -std=c99 -g -o gdbLab gdbLab.c -lm
 *
 * TODO: 2. Execute Using
 *  ./gdbLab
 *
 * TODO: 3. Debug Using
 *  gdb ./gdbLab
 *
 * TIPS
 * -> Run the executable in GDB. It should tell you where the segmentation fault
 *    is occuring. Boom, thats one thing out of the way.
 *
 * -> Now is the hard part. Why is is occuring? This is where your brain might
 *    hurt. You will need to step through each instruction one at a time and
 *    validate the values held in the variables. Read the tutorial properly.
 *
 * -> Read all the comments in this file. The answer lies in them. It is an
 *    obvious answer as soon as you spot the problem.
 *
 * NOTE: In case you want to experiment with this source code, copy it
 *       into a new file and then experiment with it.
