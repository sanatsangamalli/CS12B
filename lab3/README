gdbLab.c was a program written for us in C intentionally with errors. We had to find 
the errors using the gdb. I found a segmentation fault occured in findDistance() 
function on line 109 according to gdb. When I investigated further I found that 
firstPoint and secondPoint are both 0 when passed into findDistance(). thisCoordinate.x = x 
should be thisCoordinate->x = x for lines 78-79. In addition, on line 75 there is no initial 
memory allocated on the heap for thisCoordinate. So I had to include stdlib.h and used calloc().
Also on line 87 for the return statment, you should just return thisCoordinate instead 
of its memory address.
