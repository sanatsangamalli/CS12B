This assignment is called left, right, and center. First you run main. 
The user is prompted to enter a seed from which random numbers are 
generated and for the number of players in the game(can be up to 10).
I kept an array to keep track of the amount of money each player is. 
I first initialized each value to $3 per the game rules. Inside of a 
while loop(with condition of checking if the number of active players 
is not equal to 1), I had two nested for loops that would run the game.
I kept track of the amount of money each player had, the amountof money 
in the pot, and the number of active players. For my outer for loop, I 
had an if statement because if the player has no money they get no rolls 
so it would just skip the code inside. It also checked if the number of 
active players equaled one. That meant the game was over. Inside, I had 
an if-else block to figureout the number of rolls a player got, to run my 
nested for loop that many times. In my nested for loop, I generated a random 
face using the rand() method. I had a switch statement to decide what to then 
do. For the cases Left and Right,I had to handle cases where the index fell
off the end of the array. I also had a method to check the number of players 
in the game by checking how much money they had. After the while loop(meaning someone won), 
I had a for loop to check the index of the person that won(they were the only one 
that had money) and printed the winning message. Ultimately, I kept track 
of the number of active players, the amount of money in the pot, and the number 
of rolls for each player.
