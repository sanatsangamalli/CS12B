cat.c is a program which performs the functions of the cat 
command in unix. Since this is a short program, all the code
is in main. I wrote an if-statement to handle the base case 
where there is only one argument entered in on the comand line. 
There is a while loop to make sure that it terminates when there
is nothing left to be read. Afterward I had a for loop. Inside,
I set the file descriptor equal to open function with parameters
of the current argument and the read-only flag. I also wrote an
if-statement to handle the error case. Then I wrote a do-while 
loop to run while there are arguments to be read. Then I called
the read and write functions, and wrote if-statements to handle the
error cases. Outside the for loop, I closed the file descriptor and
wrote another if-statement to handle the error case. Then I wrote
a new line for seperation. Then the return statement.
